# G.Assets – Asset Hub for Game Developers and Creators

G.Assets is a streamlined web application designed to help creators and game developers store, manage, and access digital assets in one place.  
It provides a clean interface for uploading your work, browsing community assets, and organizing everything neatly for development use.

## Overview

The platform functions as a lightweight asset library meant to simplify how developers and designers handle their files.  
Instead of scattering assets across folders, drives, and links, G.Assets brings them into a unified and structured space.  
The focus is on clarity, quick access, and a creator-friendly workflow.
